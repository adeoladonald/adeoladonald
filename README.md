# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Donald

I'm a junior web developer passionate about building useful tools with JavaScript and Python.

Trying to master:
- JavaScript: The language that lets me break my website  
- Kali Linux: The OS that lets me break everything else (ethically)
  
ðŸ“¦ Projects:
- [IoT Intrusion Detection](https://github.com/adeoladonald/NIDS)
- [Paired Health Website](https://pairedhealthsolutions.org.uk)

ðŸ“š If it compiles, ships, or hacks â€” I want to learn it.

ðŸŒ± Always learning, always building.
